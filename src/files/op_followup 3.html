<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>One way to engage students in
deeper thinking about fractions as operators is to use manipulatives or
drawings to have them visually demonstrate what happens during the
multiplication process.  Cramer and Bezuk (1991)
and Bezuk &amp; Armstrong (1992)
published a variety of visualization-based activities for students to engage in
in order to both demonstrate and to build upon their understanding of fraction
multiplication using counters and area models.  In these activities, students
are provided with a set of counters or a blank rectangular area and are then
asked to select or to shade in a number of counters or a space in the rectangle
that represents a given fraction of the whole.  Next, they are asked to select
a given fraction of their first selection.  For example, if a student is given
eight counters and is asked to identify <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;position:relative;
top:6.0pt'><img width=5 height=20 src="op_followup.fld/image001.png"></span> of
the set, they should select six counters.  If they are then asked to then find <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;position:relative;
top:6.0pt'><img width=5 height=20 src="op_followup.fld/image002.png"></span> of
the <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;position:relative;
top:6.0pt'><img width=5 height=20 src="op_followup.fld/image001.png"></span> selection,
they should pick three of the six counters that they chose.  They may verify
that <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;position:relative;
top:6.0pt'><img width=44 height=20 src="op_followup.fld/image003.png"></span>,
and they did indeed end up with three of the original eight counters.  In this
activity, teacher will want to look for the ways in which the students interact
with the pieces at each stage.  If they still include the pieces that have been
removed in the first round, then they are likely having trouble understanding
the ways in which multiplying fractions stacks in that each round cuts out more
and more of the original.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Another option for
formatively assessing students’ understanding of fractions as operators is to
have them engage in problem posing activities in which they generate their own
mathematical questions based on a prompt (Silver,
1994).  In this case, a teacher might provide a student with a scenario and ask
them to write a question that someone would use fraction multiplication to
solve.  As an example, let us say that one lap around a track is <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;position:relative;
top:6.0pt'><img width=5 height=20 src="op_followup.fld/image004.png"></span> of
a mile.  If a student writes a question such as, “If Mary runs <span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;position:relative;
top:6.0pt'><img width=14 height=20 src="op_followup.fld/image005.png"></span> laps
around the track, how many miles did she run?”, then it is more likely that
they understand the operator function of fractions than if they write a
question such as, “How many laps would Alan need to run if he wanted to run 2
miles?”, which would be solved using fraction division.  Alternatively,
students who are new to these ideas may be presented with both of these
questions and asked which one represents a multiplicative relationship and to
give a reason for their answer.  These types of problem-posing activities can
help students focus in on the structural aspects of these operations (English,
1997) and also allows them to practice constructing arguments to defend their
choice of problem (Common
Core State Standards Initiative, 2010).</p>
