<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            The measurement
interpretation encompasses a fairly wide range of skills and understandings
that students need to develop.  One of these is the ability to determine
relative magnitudes of rational number values regardless of form.  Having
students place rational numbers on number lines with different sets of
benchmark values, some more helpful than others, is an excellent way to see
students’ thinking about relative magnitudes and equipartitioning.  If a
student is given a number line that is partitioned into fourths and is asked to
plot <span

top:6.0pt'><img width=5 height=20 src="meas_followup.fld/image001.png"></span>,
that would likely be easier than if they were provided with one that was split
into eighths or halves or not split between zero and one at all.  Even more
difficult would be a number line divided into fifths, as students could not use
halving strategies in the same way as with the other examples.  Furthermore,
older students may be able to place fraction, decimal, and percentage values on
the same number line or to directly compare the magnitudes of these values
using symbolic notation (&lt;, &gt;, =).  Making use of combinations of these
three representational forms can not only reveal any misconceptions that
students have but can also help students further develop conceptual connections
between them, which strengthens their ability to make use of the underlying
structures.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>During this
activity, the teacher will want to watch for the strategies that students use
to place values on a number line or to compare values.  If a student always
resorts to finding a decimal equivalent when comparing values, for example,
they may not have a fully developed understanding of equivalent fractions, or they
may have trouble with the fair sharing idea that more pieces of the same whole
result in smaller pieces.  A student who understands these concepts should be
able to compare 2/5 and 7/8 by either creating two new fractions with common
denominators (16/40 &lt; 35/40) or by reasoning that 1/5 &lt; 1/8, which means
that 7/8 is much closer to 1, as it is missing only one piece compared to three
pieces, and that the missing piece is smaller than each of the three missing
pieces in 2/5.  Similarly, difficulty placing a value greater than one on a
number line may reveal troubles viewing fractions as iterators that can be
applied as many times as needed to obtain a given value (e.g., iterating 1/3
seven times will result in 5/3).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Teachers may also check
students’ understandings of iteration using other formative assessment
activities such as that described by Simon and colleagues (2018). 
They discussed a task in which a student is given a unit bar made of four
pieces and additional materials and is asked to create a bar that is 7/4 of a
unit.  A student in this situation may then create the new bar by adding three
more units of the same size as the original four to the bar they were given. 
If students respond that you cannot have more than four pieces, then they are
likely misunderstanding that unit fractions may be iterated to create new
fractions of various sizes, including values larger than one.  Another option is
to go in the other direction by asking students to measure a longer bar with a
smaller one.  In their task, a carpenter needs to get a beam that is the same
size as one her already has.  He plans to measure the longer beam with a
shorter one that he has available, and it turns out that seven of the shorter beams
fit into the longer one.  This 1/7 length is then used to find the lengths of
other beams of various sizes.  Using manipulatives or drawings to construct a
composite value through iteration in this way allows students to practice
“us[ing] appropriate tools strategically” (Common
Core State Standards Initiative, 2010, p. 7).</p>
