    <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The measurement interpretation encompasses a fairly wide range of skills and understandings
    that students need to develop.&nbsp; One of these is the ability to determine
    relative magnitudes of rational number values regardless of form.&nbsp; Having
    students place rational numbers on number lines with different sets of
    benchmark values, some more helpful than others, is an excellent way to see
    students’ thinking about relative magnitudes and equipartitioning.&nbsp; If a
    student is given a number line that is partitioned into fourths and is asked to
    plot 1/4, that would likely be easier than if they were provided with one that was split
    into eighths or halves or not split between zero and one at all.&nbsp; Even more
    difficult would be a number line divided into fifths, as students could not use
    halving strategies in the same way as with the other examples.&nbsp; Furthermore,
    older students may be able to place fraction, decimal, and percentage values on
    the same number line or to directly compare the magnitudes of these values
    using symbolic notation (&lt;, &gt;, =).&nbsp; Making use of combinations of these
    three representational forms can not only reveal any misconceptions that
    students have but can also help students further develop conceptual connections
    between them, which strengthens their ability to make use of the underlying
    structures.&nbsp; </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%">During this
    activity, the teacher will want to watch for the strategies that students use
    to place values on a number line or to compare values.&nbsp; If a student always
    resorts to finding a decimal equivalent when comparing values, for example,
    they may not have a fully developed understanding of equivalent fractions, or they
    may have trouble with the fair sharing idea that more pieces of the same whole
    result in smaller pieces.&nbsp; A student who understands these concepts should be
    able to compare 2/5 and 7/8 by either creating two new fractions with common
    denominators (16/40 &lt; 35/40) or by reasoning that 1/5 &lt; 1/8, which means
    that 7/8 is much closer to 1, as it is missing only one piece compared to three
    pieces, and that the missing piece is smaller than each of the three missing
    pieces in 2/5.&nbsp; Similarly, difficulty placing a value greater than one on a
    number line may reveal troubles viewing fractions as iterators that can be
    applied as many times as needed to obtain a given value (e.g., iterating 1/3
    seven times will result in 5/3).&nbsp; </p>

    <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers may also check
    students’ understandings of iteration using other formative assessment
    activities such as that described by Simon and colleagues (2018).&nbsp;
    They discussed a task in which a student is given a unit bar made of four
    pieces and additional materials and is asked to create a bar that is 7/4 of a
    unit.&nbsp; A student in this situation may then create the new bar by adding three
    more units of the same size as the original four to the bar they were given.&nbsp;
    If students respond that you cannot have more than four pieces, then they are
    likely misunderstanding that unit fractions may be iterated to create new
    fractions of various sizes, including values larger than one.&nbsp; Another option is
    to go in the other direction by asking students to measure a longer bar with a
    smaller one.&nbsp; In their task, a carpenter needs to get a beam that is the same
    size as one her already has.&nbsp; He plans to measure the longer beam with a
    shorter one that he has available, and it turns out that seven of the shorter beams
    fit into the longer one.&nbsp; This 1/7 length is then used to find the lengths of
    other beams of various sizes.&nbsp; Using manipulatives or drawings to construct a
    composite value through iteration in this way allows students to practice
    “us[ing] appropriate tools strategically” (Common
    Core State Standards Initiative, 2010, p. 7).</p>
