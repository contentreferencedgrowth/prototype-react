<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            There are several ways
that equipartioning can be taken up in the classroom.  Wilson and colleagues (2012)
gave an example of students fairly sharing 24 gold coins between pirates.  This
activity is highly adaptable in that the teacher can easily change the focus
based on the question asked.  In order to focus on partitive division, they may
ask something like, “If there are six pirates, how many coins would each get?” 
This question can easily be reversed to emphasize quotative division by asking,
“If each pirate got four gold coins, how many pirates were in the group?”  The
students can also be given manipulatives to stand in for the coins and can be
asked to create a separate pile for each pirate.  During this activity, teacher
will want to pay close attention to the strategies that students use, as their
partitioning methods can give great insight into how they see the values
involved and how well they are attending to the mathematical practice of
attending to “regularity in repeated reasoning” (Common
Core State Standards Initiative, 2010, p. 8).  Students may “deal” the coins
individually or in small groups until they are all gone or they may divide the
number of coins by the number of pirates if their understanding is more
advanced.  If the student creates nonequal shares, the teacher might ask a
question such as, “Which share of treasure would you rather have?” (Wilson
et al., 2012, p. 484).  If a student selects one group because it has the most
gold coins, this is a sign that their splitting algorithm did not create fair
shares, and the student may need to reconsider their approach.  Similarly, if
the student does not use all of the coins, they may be asked what should happen
to those coins.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            This splitting activity
can also help students to “look for and make use of structure” (Common
Core State Standards Initiative, 2010, p. 7) by using multiple equivalent representations
of the fractions involved.  Students may use the manipulatives previously
described, draw pictures of the groups, and write fractions in symbolic
notation.  Students who are beginning to develop the measurement
conceptualization of fractions may also be able to convert their unit fractions
into decimals or percentages such that each pirate in our example gets 4/24 of
the coins, which is around 16.7% of the total number of coins.</p>
